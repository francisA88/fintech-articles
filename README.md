Codes, articles and side projects in the world of finance APIs


### What am I doing?

Oh well, I've decided to write tutorials and guides on using finance APIs as a backend engineer based in Nigeria.


The aim? Help others overcome the hurdles I've overcome, from poor documentations to problems that seem to have no solution, especially to a beginner.


### What's the plan for now?


It's simple: Work on short side projects, write on them, as well as on other projects I've done long ago; help fellow backend engineers and developers, and gain publicity.


### Well, okay, how do we start?


We (you and I) will begin this journey with Flutterwave, one of the biggest fintech service providers offering payment infrastructure and financial APIs across Africa.
